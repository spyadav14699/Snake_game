## About this game 

Snake game is a recreation of the old game Snake, but it contains features such as multiplayer mode and that the gaming area can be divided in multiple screens. It was designed using Javascript as main language and a library called Socket.io to make the connection between the screens.

To control the snakes, we created a web control that simulates a joystick, where you press buttons to join the game, set when ready and arrow keys to move to a desired direction.

The first thing you need to do is to test the game and learn about its functionality. To do that, go to the GitHub repository and clone the project in your computer.

When you finish running and testing the project, your task is to write the project documentation based on what you learned in the task ""Learn about the Markdown markup language and the README.md file"" and what you understood from the project functionality and code. Feel free to ask questions about the creation process, code and any other doubt that comes to your mind.
